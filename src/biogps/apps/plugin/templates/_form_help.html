<h2>URL Template Syntax</h2>
<p>You need to supply the URL to the website you want to add
as a plugin, including one (or more) keywords. When you then
use your plugin in a layout, the appropriate identifier for
your gene of interest will be substituted in.</p>
<p>For example, to make a simple Google search plugin, you would
type in the URL below, then click
the "Add Keyword" button and select whichever identifier you want.<br>
<b>http://www.google.com/search?q=</b></p>
<p>Once you have picked an identifier, the URL template
will then look like this:<br>
<b>http://www.google.com/search?q=&#123;&#123;Symbol&#125;&#125;</b></p>
<p>When the plugin is then used in a layout to look at a gene,
BioGPS will automatically insert the correct value. For
example, if you used the UniGene ID keyword and the user
is looking at CDK2, the actual URL that will load would be
this:<br>
<b>http://www.google.com/search?q=Hs.19192</b></p>
<p>If you want to test your URL template before saving, just hit
the "Test" button at the bottom of this page.
